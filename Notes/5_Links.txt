==================================


//Relative Links

if you have two files in the same directory/folder, index.html and food.html, you can link from index.html to food.html by doing something like this:


<a href="food.html">This is a link to food.html!</a>


If you want your relative link to be relative to the root instead of the current, folder/directory, start the link off with a /. Also important to know, if you want to make your links open a new tab, give it a target attribute with the value of _blank, like so:

	
<a href="food.html" target="_blank" >This link will open in a new tab.</a>


==================================


//ID Links

Another popular use of the anchor tag is giving the href attribute a value of an id of another element on the page. Clicking on this link will make your browser scroll to that element on the page. This is useful for skipping large sections of your page.


<html>
		<head>
			<title>ID Link</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<p>
				<a href="#cereal">Click here to scroll to a good cereal.</a>
			</p>
			<p id="cereal">Corn Flakes</p>
		</body>
	</html>
